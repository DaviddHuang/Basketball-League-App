#### Why is this project of interest to you?

Basketball has surrounded me my whole entire life, whether that was as a player or a fan, I have always been 
connected to the sport. When competing in casual leagues in school and out of school, I always dreamt of having a way
to keep track of not only my own stats, but those on other teams as well. With this project, I hope to combine my love
for the game of basketball and my passion in computer science in hopes of creating something that is of use to players
with the same love for the sport as me.
